# 🩺 Patient Data Analysis using Python

This repository contains an assignment project focused on analyzing patient health data using Python. It covers three important aspects of data science and AI-related programming.

## 🔍 Q1: Outlier Detection
- Detected and removed outliers in the `BloodPressure` column using the IQR method.
- Visualized boxplots before and after cleaning.

## 📊 Q2: Hypothesis Testing
- **One-sample t-test:** Tested if the mean `CholesterolLevel` differs significantly from 195 mg/dL.
- **Chi-square test:** Checked for a relationship between `Gender` and `RiskCategory`.
- Included null/alternative hypotheses, test statistics, p-values, and interpretations.

## 📈 Q3: First-Order ODE Modeling
- Modeled the concentration of a drug in the bloodstream using:  
  	**dC/dt = k(D - C)** with k = 0.05, D = 120, C(0) = 0
- Simulated from t = 0 to 100 and plotted the result.

## 📁 Dataset
The analysis is based on a CSV file named `patient_data.csv` included in this repository.
